            "I was scared at first to order the size I normally wear, UK8, in case the waist would be too tight with the accessory attached to it. I was hoping it wouldn\u2019t dig into my stomach and be uncomfortable but I stayed to my regular size and It sits perfectly without it being a bother. Love it so much! Quality is fantastic, a nice soft silky feel to it!",
