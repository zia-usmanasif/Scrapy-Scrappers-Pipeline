      "Our first alpaca sweater. With a cool rib pattern and a crew neckline, the Alpaca Crew has all the warmth of a cozy winter knit with a plush, airy feel. Alpacas are lighter on the planet with their soft hooves and gentle grazing—making them easier on pastures than other herd animals. Our airy alpaca yarn is prickle-free, long-lasting, and pilling-resistant.\r\nWe’re committed to sourcing the most ethical products across our supply chain. For all animal fibers, we take extra precautions to ensure humane treatment. For more information, check out our sustainability initiatives. "

      "Love the alpaca crew neck sweater!   I bought it in the beautiful blue and always get compliments!   It’s very lightweight but yet warm.  It also fits  comfortably under any of my coats.  Great quality and very classy!",
      "Sweater has the relaxed fit that seems to be everywhere. I purchased the beautiful grey color because Everlane gets it right.  Not too dark, not too light just a very flattering color. Sweater is a timeless piece that blends well with most things in my closet. Sweater is very soft, warm and I hope to get a lot of wear out of it over the years.  Everlane’s products go the distance and really last if they are cared for.",
      "This sweater fits just like the photos and is warm but also breathable, so you don't overheat! Easy to layer under and up-levels a look.",
      "This sweater is so lovely, and warm. I absolutely love it. I have had another in a different color for a few years. Love them so much that now I have two.",
      "Love that its light weight but still so warm!! So cozy!",
      "dressed up or cozy at home this is my go-to sweater!",
      "The hype is real! I want one in every color and I would wear this daily if I could. The only negative thing I can say is that it is dry clean only. I did size down from my normal top size and it was still roomy.",
      "I first purchased the XS in almond after reading reviews.  I returned it for a small in taupe. Size is much better and in keeping with the more oversized fit that’s in style. I’m 112 pound, 5”4. Love the taupe colour, almond is nice, but washed me out. I would wear this everyday if that wasn’t weird! A tad itchy around the neck, but not annoyingly so. Have yet to wash it."

      "Bought the same shirt years ago and even tho the color was wrong for me I kept it because I loved the material so I was glad to see they still sell it. They hold up well and never go out of style",
      "This will be my \"go to\" white blouse! The fabric is smooth and silky and the fit it comfortably oversized without looking sloppy.",
      "There’s something about the brown on brown stripe paired with black pants or black skirt that looks so good. It’s so soft for cotton and drapes perfectly. It just looks effortless and that’s all I want from my clothes. It’s not a traditionally sexy shirt but there’s something about it. . . ",
      "For Context: I’m a mildly frumpy 5’4”, 130 lb mom & trust that I look good in this shirt.",
      "I’m certain I’ll wear this shirt frequently; it’s just right for the weather we have in the South. I like lightweight shirts with long sleeves to keep mosquitoes off and this shirt does that and looks good. I’m so glad I checked with customer service about sizing. I was advised to order a 10 instead of a 12 and that was the right call for me with my short torso. The 10 had more than enough length for my frame.",
      "True to description   Nice product to add to my everlane collection.",

      "It is the perfect material and fit. It can be worn any way. So worth it!",

      "Everlane bodysuits are the best. True to size, probably a little tight, and double layered so they're very smoothing.",
      "It’s a perfect fit. Buttery soft and so comfortable.",
      "Love the fabric quality and weight. The neckline is so flattering. Exceptional quality",
      "Perfect body suit, the thickness of the fabric is just right, I’m a 34c and I feel supported with out a bra,  I noticed the sleeves feel a bit tight, I order a two of these lol in small but probably could have worn a medium comfortably too, the small fits great I’m afraid it will shrink though so I’m avoiding the dryer",
      "People have said order a size up but I found that not to be true it is fitted but a size up makes it baggy and wrinkly. I always take everlane small and am glad the size is consistent throughout the  store. (UK 8, everlane Small). I am normally weary of bodysuits as they are often too short in the torso and so end up pulling on my shoulders and behind. This has a good length too it. Uk return process was easy.",
      "Love this bodysuit - the double layer in the body is a great design, and the neckline is lovely. I'm typically a size 6 / M, but I bought both M and L and prefer the L (especially in the white which is generally a less forgiving color). The M felt skin-tight and sleeves were a bit short on my long arms, but L was perfect and still comfortable. Don't love the placement of the snaps compared to other bodysuits I have, and wish there were double snap options, but it's not a deal breaker.",
      "I love this square neck bodysuit. It’s flattering and can work all year round. I purchased black and white as a winter base layer but now I am eager to wear it in spring and summer and just push the sleeves up. The material is so comfortable and my long torso appreciates the stretch. Highly recommend!",

      "I have two. I started with the Medium, and bought an addition one in small. I am learning my size with Everlane, but can't turn loose the roomier option, I love having the choice.  The shirt is soft and flattering, with just the right amount of flare. I have washed them several times and I like to dry on low briefly and hang to finish drying. This gets me out of the ironing conundrum. I love them with my dream pants and my easy pants. My favorite is thing is you cannot see through these shirts! I really love the arm length, and turn the cuffs up once.",
      "Soft, but keeps its shape. Wide, but not weirdly so. Nice color!",
      "Fabric is a nice heavy weight, soft to the touch and looks good even if you don’t iron the shirt. No shrinking even with drying in high heat. Choose your size based on the garment dimensions because this is a boxy fit.",
      "I exchanged the blue for a white!  It’s great. It’s full, crisp, comfortable. Received compliments when I wore it to a party last night. I’m about to buy it in striped!  Great shirt!!",
      "I bought 7!! It is made of good quality material. I like how it is oversized. I got my size and it is pretty oversized. I could size down but I am glad I did not. I wear these to office and got so many compliments.",
      "These shirts are made of nice thick cotton which washes well and is easy to iron. They are structured yet soft.",
      "I now own this in 2 colours. I love the versatile style, I wear it in work and also on casual occasions.",
      "I’m a petite UK8 and the size S overwhelms me a bit, XS is perfect for me.",
      "I love this shirt. Heavier weight- so it’s not see through. Comes out of wash wearable and looks great ironed. It’s a great length for me as I’m shorter & I love the boxy fit, I would suggest sizing down if you’re going for a less casual look. I got my fav color in both sizes- have xl & l- usu I’m 1-2x. I took out every other Oxford from my closet as I only wear these!",
      "I was so impressed with the quality, fit and style of the chambray boxy Oxford, I immediately ordered the pin stripe! ",
      "The versatility of this silhouette goes from layering as a light jacket over a tank top to wearing it alone to layering a sweater over it in the cooler season. This is a perfect core basic for a capsule wardrobe."

The band could be a smidge tighter and the cup area a smidge bigger but it’s comfortable and stays in place, I don’t find myself tugging or adjusting or eager to take it off, and it looks good both under clothes and by itself. I love the pewter color. I’ve ordered several green and green-adjacent items from Everlane lately and am liking the colors a lot.",

      "This fits well and runs true to size. I tend to run hot and this is comfortable. The elastic does get saggy after a year, which is when I replace it.",
      "I love this bra for several reasons. The cotton fabric breathes and is so much more comfortable than bras made of synthetic materials.  It also gives me just the right amount of support and does better than most wireless bras.  The top of the bra stays put and does not slide down during the day and expose your nipples.  To me, it's perfect, but unfortunately, it looks like you don't have it anymore.  I would have bought more of them.",
      "I absolutely love this bra. I've tried multiple wireless bras and was always left disappointed either because of a lack of adjustability, or just drab appearance (we all like to feel good, right?). After purchasing Everlane’s cotton bralette, I had to come back and purchase the other colors. ",

      "Finally! A button up that needs nothing worn underneath (even the white color), has a relaxed but not too boxy fit, and made of such nice, soft material. I wear these all the time both at work and socially. Wish there were more colors!",
      "5’9” 36D, size 6 ordered is perfect with plenty of room for comfort.",
      "Love this top. Not too oversized so if you're between sizes this is something to consider",
      "Love the color and shape of this shirt - Whether it's a dress up to business meetings or casual wear with sport shoes, it's just perfect. I bought a size up to make it more trendy!",
      "This is the white button up shirt I have had in my mind for years. It’s the perfect thickness, it’s not see through, not too tight, and it does not wrinkle up as soon as you put it on. It also washed really well. I hung it to dry and did not have to iron. I love it!",
      "It's the perfect Oxford shirt. It's thicker than expected, but perfect for fall!",
      "I can't remember when I bought my first Everlane oxford, a lovely pale pink (I did have to buy one size larger to have enough to tuck in) that was perfect for the office and late dinners, whether posh or jeans. The fabric is just the right weight to be crisp, comfortable and no-show, and washes and dries beautifully with just a shake and into my closet. I've smeared coffee, chocolate, plum and blood on this shirt, and it cleans up beautifully. Needless to say I've several shirts in multiple colors, the fit and comfort is that good.",
      "Great shirt - looks good whether ironed or worn free from the drier a little crinkly. The fabric has a good (heavy) weight so it keeps me warm around the house; but not too warm to wear min summer. The fine blue stripe is a nice light colour (not navy blue).",
      "Only downside…the shirts used to have buttoned collar, which meant the collar always looked good fresh out of the drier. These buttons are gone, so now need to iron / shape the collar.",
      "I love these shirts. I have 3 that I wear all the time. I do wish you would make more colors."

      "I was looking for a long sleeve shirt that was a bit more than a T-shirt. This is it. Heavy weight almost sweater like, this crew is perfect. I know it will get worn again and again this fall and winter. The perfect layer that can be dressed up or down.",
      "Only flaw is some loose threads, but I loce this sweater. if it cane in other colors that flattered me (blue, lavender, charcoal grey) I would buy.",
      "I adore this top. These days, I purchase exclusively denim from Everlane but this top caught my eye immediately and I am glad I went for it. ",
      "Material is heftier than your normal rib knits but still slinky and quite body-hugging. The fabric has a decent recovery and doesn’t stretch out too much. ",
      "I purchased a size M which fits perfectly for wider shoulders and a larger bust while still being somewhat close-fitting at the waist.",
      "This top is comfortable and basic but casually elevated.  I got the camel (it is not as \"warm\" tone as I would like and a bit more \"flecked\" but I like it).  It has a cotton-y feel to it.  Mid weight.  stretchy and forgiving.  Slim fit in tts but not tight.  Liked it so much I also ordered bone and black.",
      "I got one in camel and and one in charcoal. Love! Dresses up for business casual, dresses down for weekends. The white color was more see-through than the others when I tried them on in the store. I can wear a nude bra under camel and charcoal, but you can kinda see it under the white color. Otherwise, I wouldn't hesitate to buy in more colors",
      "I love the fabric, which is substantial rib cotton blend.  Very comfortable.  I did size up for a little ease in how it fits.  I have already worn it several times since it arrived, a sign of a great purchase!",
      "Very soft and perfect alone or over shirts. Bought a size up to wear over shirts.",
      "I am very impressed by the fabric, it’s breathabiliy and warmth.  I wanted white as well but it was sold out. Please restock these, Everlane!"

      "Love these leggings for lounging, working out, layering, etc. They are a great basic staple in my closet! I will say the coloring in the photos is a true pine green while they are a bit more of a sage green tone in person.",
      "Super comfortable and nice designs. Love those pants and I got several after I purchased this one!",
      "Wore these leggings to a hot hatha yoga class and they held up great. They stayed up for the most part, didn’t display obvious sweat marks, and the ankle length was perfect for my height (5”5). The material is lightweight and breathable but not see through. I’m not sure I’d wear them for high intensity workouts but I love them for hot yoga or just running errands.",
      "Somewhat tight on first wear but fitted well after couple of hours exercising. 100 per cent comfortable & perfect ankle length for a 5 footer.",
      "I just bought my first two pairs of everlane leggings and I was so pleasantly surprised at the quality and fit. They are comfortable enough for daily wear but highly functional for fitness. And the colors are great. Excited for my next pairs."

      "I buy the medium because it gives enough room for layering and comfort. This versatile zip with pockets is a must for me, because winter drafts drive me crazy.  I notice this style seems to be a hit for others not just me. Not really pink but more peach, but goes with everything really.",
      "Great color and extremely comfortable! I may buy more.",
      "So soft, ordered one size larger than usual as I'll most likely layer this piece. Such a pretty color. Planning on using it to travel, planes can be so chilly. Only disappointment, no pockets.",
      "I have several Everlane track sweatshirts, but this one is the softest-inside and out. I love the neutral Penguin color!! Full body fabric with sturdy zipper! Looking forward to “shorts and sweatshirts “ weather!! Washes and dries like a dream!!",

      "Your favorite tee, now in long sleeves. The Supima® Micro-Rib Long-Sleeve Scoop-Neck was such a fan-favorite, we’ve added a long sleeve style into the lineup. Made with our super-soft, fine-ribbed Supima® cotton® with a touch of stretch, it has a slim fit, with just a center-back seam. It’s the perfect layering piece or new favorite top.  Grown in the United States, Supima® cotton is distinguished by its extra-long fiber length, which gives it more durability and a softer hand feel. Supima® is able to authenticate the source of its cotton across the entire supply chain, from the fiber and yarn to the fabric and finished product."

      "I looked at this blazer for ages. After receiving it, I wondered why I had been on the fence for so long. The fit is perfection. Overall the workmanship is impeccable, and wearing the blazer instantly elevates anything I’m wearing. I did size down for a more fitted look. Well done Everlane!",
      "Smart, tailored fit. Beautifully made. Retro look, yet modern at the same time.",
      "I've been looking for an oversize blazer for a while and this one is so simple and elegant yet unique with the peach hue. It runs true to size given the oversized nature of the product, but it fit well in shoulders and sleeves.",
      "I saw fashion influencer Emily Wheatley wearing it on YouTube. She belted it & it looked terrific. Lots of ways to style it & it always looks and feels terrific.",
      "Love the fabric, cut and quality of this blazer! Super comfortable and  perfect for work!",
      "I love how this blazer gives a slightly oversized look, yet does not look sloppy!  I took my usual Everlane size and it fits wonderfully.  The sleeves are on the shorter side, but I tend to push my sleeves up anyway.  The fabric is strong, yet not stiff.  I own this blazer in 2 other colours.  It is just so well made and fits beautifully.",
      "This is my third Everlane Oversized Blazer and it's fantastic! I bought this with the matching black Tencel™ Way-High® Taper Pant and it will be in my wardrobe for years. It is an off-black color and the sleeve length is perfect on me (usually sleeves are too long on me so I can see how the sleeves might be too short for some people or how it is shown in the model picture). I'm usually a 00 with Everlane outerwear but an xsmall for other Everlane tops. I love that I can dress this up or down easily. It will probably be my next interview outfit and then I can go out that night wearing it! The fabric does seem pretty delicate... mine was shipped with a small part of the fabric \"tugged out\" around the neck (very small and behind my hair so not noticeable at all). It did have an orange sticker on the tag (meaning it was returned once) so I wish it did not have that fabric piece \"tugged out\" but that is just me being very picky because it's very small.",

      "I have been eyeing the way drape pant for quite a long time. One day I stepped into the store and tried them on. The fit was great, but I wasn’t really sure about the ash brown color. I took a chance and lo and behold over the past few weeks these have been my go-to pair of pants, so much so that I am already considering buying the same pair in the sandstone. A quick note on fit. While I am technically petite-5’1” and shrinking, lol-I have long legs and a short waist. As a result, I found the length to be pretty perfect on me. I can even wear sneakers with these pants!",
      "Fantastic, outstanding, perfect trousers. I’m 5’9” with a 27”",
      "waist and 39” hips, and the size 4R is a dream fit. (In fact, they’re *almost* too long, which is something I never thought I’d say about a pair of Everlane pants.) I’m incredibly pleased with the quality, too—the fabric is heavy enough to drape nicely, and it doesn’t seem to wrinkle badly. I bought the navy blue pinstripe colorway, and I get compliments every single time. So pleased!",
      "As I’m only 5’4” I had to have these hemmed one turn. To say they’re stylish but extremely comfortable seems too much of an understatement. If I could get away with it, I would wear them every day. So glad I took the chance and bought them. I bought my regular size 4 and they fit beautifully.",
      "I love these pants!  Great fit and if you are tall the length is long enough to drape.  The material has body and the colour a true navy.",
      "I'm so happy for this trend, we have been waiting for PANTS and these remind me of city dressing in the 90s when I lived in NYC and London. I also have super long legs and being able to wear pants that actually go onto my shoes is heaven. ",

      "Love these pants. High waisted perfection. Pants sit just above the belly button, so perfect for cropped shirts. Also great with tucked in shirts, sweaters or whatever. Soft, comfortable fabric that holds shape and doesn’t wrinkle. Perfect length - slight drag with flats and perfect with 2-3 inch heels. I’m 5’7” 155lbs and size 8 fits perfect with plenty of breathing room."

      "These are my favorite jeans! One of the best pairs I’ve ever had",
      "I absolutely love Everlane jeans!! They live up to the hype with their amazing quality and durability. These are my second pair of Everlane jeans and I’m in love with the fit. It’s high waisted so I feel like it holds everything in place (long torso, big butt lol). These jeans will probably last me a long time.",
      "These jeans are super comfortable, the perfect amount of stretch and I love the fit. They come just above my ankles and I’m 5’4”. Ordered size 27 (135 lbs) in the ankle length and these run true to size. These are my second pair in the original cheeky jeans and I get so much wear out of them.",

      "I’m a 30 year old mom of 3 in 3 years so more softness, less perk in the body arena. These jeans flatten and support my tummy, snatch my waist and inner thigh, and smooth out all the extra love in my curves. My favorite thing though? The BOOTY! It’s the best I’ve looked in a pair of jeans even before kids! I love my body the way it is and WOWZA these jeans just amp it up a notch! ",
      "I’m 5’5, fluctuating anywhere from 132-140 pounds. I ordered a 26 which is my normal size. When I’m on the lower end of my weight range, these jeans fit perfectly. On the higher end, there really isn’t a ton of stretch so I could to with a size up as it feels too tight in my tummy. ",
      "Length: I have both the shortest length and the middle “average” length. I wore my shortest length with a pair of ankle booties and hiking socks and there was still a significant portion of sock showing which for me was too much. Id say if you are my height and wanting a casual summer jean with sandals, you can do shortest length, otherwise I’d go for the middle one. ",

      "Heavy denim but very flattering cut. I don’t recommend sizing up.",
      "Gorgeous wide-leg jeans! The fit is perfect if you’re looking for very high-waisted (just under the ribcage) and have a medium to long-ish torso. The wide leg is just right- not comically wide but definitely more than a straight leg. As always with Everlane, the fabric is beautiful and substantial. They have just enough stretch to be comfortable while still feeling held in. The bone color is ideal for summer months all the way through winter. I did have to go up from my usual 31 to a 32 due to the high waist being a bit more pinched. I purchased the 27.5” length and they just brush the top of my sneakers.",
      "Flattering, simple and casual, yet elegant. I love that Everlane’s clothes (these jeans and in general) are thoughtfully made with un-outsourced production. I’ve seriously considered donating *all* my old clothes and buying the rest of my outfits exclusively from Everlane 😍. Just need to win the lottery first 💸!!",
      "(Also, side note, I’m in love with the fact that no matter the gendered section, the clothes are relatively androgynous - very meaningful for a nonbinary person like myself 🖤)"

      "These jeans are my favorite thing Everlane has ever done! The denim is quality - rigid yet soft. The length is great. I can wear these with clogs, sandals, slides and boots (I have done all of the above). I get so many compliments when I wear them. I'm 5'5\" 110 Lbs with a slender build and the 24 fits great (I  wanted a tighter fit for these so sized down). Normally I am a 25 but I don't feel restricted in these since the rise is so high and the crotch length longer than what I've had in the past. I turned my best friend on to these and she purchased her regular size 26 and they fit like a glove so I recommend purchasing your true Everlane size. Thank you Everlane!!!",

But I'm 5'9\" and they hit me a bit higher than I like wearing shoes/sandals (they're my faves to wear with cowboy boots). I am so happy with the 29.5 inseam. These jeans are PERFECT. So flattering."

      "For me, it’s hard to find pants that are both comfortable and professional, but these pants make it easy. Seriously my favorite work pants. They’re even great for my pear shape, I suppose because of the pleats. Because it’s curvy-friendly, I’d recommend sizing down by one (it’s what I did).",
      "I’m in love with these pants. I bought a size 6 because I wanted a bit of room in the waist and I’m very happy (for reference I’m a 28-29” waist and 39” hip). The length is also perfect for me. The fit is great and they look amazing. I probably could have gone with a size 4 also if I wanted them more fitted. Can be dressed up or down and are super comfortable! I’m fully on the pleated, taper pant train. Please make these in more colours!! A charcoal would be amazing.",
      "Very flattering to those of us with wider hips and smaller waists.  Fabric didn’t wrinkle after wearing them all day, although the waist loosened a bit.  I’ll wear a belt with them next time I wear them.  I love them though and want other colors!!",
      "Great lighter weight fabric, perfect for transition from summer to fall and can be dressed up or down. Love the high waist fit and modern pleating.",
      "These fit a little more tightly in the waist band than my tried and true utility barrel (so size up one), but I'm obsessed. I feel cool, put together, and I'm comfortable. Instantly elevates any work outfit.",
      "I love the combo of how high waisted these pants are with the tapered leg. It gives them that different factor and feels a bit dressed up even though they’re really easy to wear. And they’re sooo soft. I sized down.",
      "I’m 5’5” (110 lbs) and these hit just around my ankle. The 00 fit perfectly. I purchased the black and I wish they came in many other neutral solid colors like olive or a dark tan/brown.",
      "I love these pants! Great cut and fabric quality. I don't usually wear pleated pants because they accentuate the widest part of my hips, but the stripes counteract that effect. The waist is high and snug, but I don't mind that."

      "The fit and fabric of these barrel pants is so great!  They are incredibly comfortable. The high waist is flattering and the looser leg is comfortable. I have two pair!",
      "I literally never write reviews about things but I love these pants so much. They are COMFY and cute. Perfect in the waist and not tight around the hips, etc. Plus the details...the button, the horizontal stripes around the belt, the soft fabric, these are maybe my favorite pants ever.",
      "I wear these pants to work on a weekly basis, summer and winter! So comfy, and perfect for the curvy people with small waist/big hips combo. Usually I’m a size 28 or 6, but since these are curvy-friendly, the size 4 was perfect.",
      "Honestly, I was not expecting to love these pants as much as I did! From the moment I put them on, I was hooked. The material is nice and stretchy, making them feel like you are wearing sweatpants, but looking more dressed up. I with they made more colors in the Tall version, but maybe soon! I will definitely be buying another pair if they do."

      "THese are so comfy and I love the drawstring in the waist.  I have wide hips and smaller waist and most \"off the rack\" pants don't fit me well.  The only thing is if I tie the waist too tight the waistband turns up a bit.  I'm 5'7\" and I love the length.  These are probably a little heavy for summer time, but perfect for fall.  Great quality.",
      "These are the most comfortable pants for work. They look nice and professional and are perfect for the fall and winter as they are pretty warm. I typically put my nicer office clothes in the dryer for 10-15 minutes to get the wrinkles out before I hang them to dry and I did that with these pants and they shrank significantly which is a big bummer. So definitely don’t put them in the dryer AT ALL.",
      "I'd live in sweats all year if I could. These give me the comfort of that while still looking polished. I have 2 colors. They are so comfy. Much appreciated 🙏🏾",
      "These are by far my fave work pants. They are so comfy, I look forward to wearing them, yet they look polished so I feel professional and put together. I can wear them with blouses or sweaters, were them business casual or dressy. They work with heels or flat. I am going to try the wide leg next.",
      "I bought the regular and wide Dream Pants. I love them both. For reference I am 5’2” about 107-110 lbs. I purchased  the XS in both styles. I tried the XXS in both but they felt too tight in the waist and bum areas. XS felt more comfortable for me.",
      "The pants falling so high above my ankles is the only thing that detracts from an otherwise good look. These are the comfiest sweatpants I’ve found that look polished and the green might be my favorite color for them, if not the black. If only they were longer!",
      "Hard truth:  I'm picky, persnickety, and particular.  I purchased these pants for travel hoping to find a comfortable but polished look that wouldn't scream, \"AMERICAN TOURIST IN EUROPE\".  Frankly they just sounded too good to be true.  But, I purchased them when they went on sale and hoped for the best.  And, boom!  They are awesome.  Comfy, sleek, polished enough to dress up when needed.  I admit to being slightly bummed that the waist was too big...right up until I discovered the handy dandy drawstring on the inside.  So, yes...they are perfect and you should quit reading reviews and just get a pair!",

Luxury—reimagined. \r\n\r\nWe created a unique blend of GRS-certified recycled cashmere and Good Cashmere Standard®-certified cashmere to give you all the beauty of traditional cashmere with a lower environmental footprint.  On one side, using recycled cashmere can lower the raw material carbon emissions of our garments by over 90%, when compared to virgin cashmere.

ZQRX™ wool is part of a particularly exclusive subset of responsible wool where over 500 wool growers are committed to continuous improvement beyond sustainability through regenerative agriculture. Grown using regenerative farming principles on over 4 million acres of land, ZQRX™ wool cuts down on carbon emissions while supporting soil regeneration and building a positive future for Merino farming."

      "This sweater is so comfortable! It’s my favorite and go to on cooler days. It is a great layering piece and so versatile. It’s a staple!",
      "I checked the body and garment dimensions and it runs very oversized. This looks great on younger women but not me. I usually wear a L, sometimes an XL. I bought the M and it is perfect! I got the camel color which is a nice neutral with all my clothes, the zipper and the collar add a bit of style to a sweater. It feels soft and the length is perfect, hits my hips. I can't report on how it washes and wears as I haven't been able to wear it that much yet.",
      "I absolutely love this sweater! They only had a small left and I’m always between a small and medium and I’m glad I sized down a bit. It doesn’t fit me as slouchy as the model shows which I like better. The length is perfect and there’s still room in the arms. Tempted to give this a 4 star because I didn’t realize this was dry clean only but really the sweater is great so it’s worth it for a good find!",
      "Knits from Everlane never fail, and this doesn’t disappoint either. It’s so cozy and looks great French tuck style. I’m sure I will wear it for years, just like my other Everlane sweaters.",
      "This half-zip meets and exceeds all expectations! I was on the fence for several months, but I’m so happy I finally pulled the trigger. The quality is superb. It is dry-clean only, FYI. Can’t wait for cooler weather!",
      "I am a fan of EVERLANE but as a woman who is petite, 5'2\" I cannot often where your fashions. This sweater however was perfect for me and the perfect weight. I loved the full sleeve and the zipper made for wearing the collar up or down. Love. PLEASE make Petites in pants. PLEASE! The shorter inseam does not do it, it's not about the length, it's about the RISE!"

      "Best straight leg ankle length dark jeans on the market.",
      "The fit is always so good.  Great quality denim, I’m devoted to the brand!",
      "I very much like this dark blue color. I’m 174sm 67 kg and have weight in mid section. The fit and overall look is owesome.",
      "These are the jeans I have been searching for. Super comfortable, hugs you in where you want them to, and the straight leg falls just right to create a lovely line. I went down a size. Looking forward to buying other colours.",
      "I want this in every color! Love the fit and look. Great quality and so comfy!!",
      "Heavy denim but very flattering cut. I don’t recommend sizing up.",
      "Gorgeous wide-leg jeans! The fit is perfect if you’re looking for very high-waisted (just under the ribcage) and have a medium to long-ish torso. The wide leg is just right- not comically wide but definitely more than a straight leg. As always with Everlane, the fabric is beautiful and substantial. They have just enough stretch to be comfortable while still feeling held in. The bone color is ideal for summer months all the way through winter. I did have to go up from my usual 31 to a 32 due to the high waist being a bit more pinched. I purchased the 27.5” length and they just brush the top of my sneakers.",
      "Flattering, simple and casual, yet elegant. I love that Everlane’s clothes (these jeans and in general) are thoughtfully made with un-outsourced production. I’ve seriously considered donating *all* my old clothes and buying the rest of my outfits exclusively from Everlane 😍. Just need to win the lottery first 💸!!",
      "(Also, side note, I’m in love with the fact that no matter the gendered section, the clothes are relatively androgynous - very meaningful for a nonbinary person like myself 🖤)"

It’s high waisted so I feel like it holds everything in place (long torso, big butt lol). These jeans will probably last me a long time.",
      "These jeans are super comfortable, the perfect amount of stretch and I love the fit. They come just above my ankles and I’m 5’4”. Ordered size 27 (135 lbs) in the ankle length and these run true to size. These are my second pair in the original cheeky jeans and I get so much wear out of them.",
      "Fit is perfect for me, and the quality never disappoints. Cotton is natural and feels great on the skin.",

      "THESE. These jeans are IT! ",
      "I’m a 30 year old mom of 3 in 3 years so more softness, less perk in the body arena. These jeans flatten and support my tummy, snatch my waist and inner thigh, and smooth out all the extra love in my curves. My favorite thing though? The BOOTY! It’s the best I’ve looked in a pair of jeans even before kids! I love my body the way it is and WOWZA these jeans just amp it up a notch! ",
      "I’m 5’5, fluctuating anywhere from 132-140 pounds. I ordered a 26 which is my normal size. When I’m on the lower end of my weight range, these jeans fit perfectly. On the higher end, there really isn’t a ton of stretch so I could to with a size up as it feels too tight in my tummy. ",
      "Length: I have both the shortest length and the middle “average” length. I wore my shortest length with a pair of ankle booties and hiking socks and there was still a significant portion of sock showing which for me was too much. Id say if you are my height and wanting a casual summer jean with sandals, you can do shortest length, otherwise I’d go for the middle one. ",

      "Love this blazer. I wanted an oversized tweed style blazer for years and finally settled on this one. It fits great & also works as a cute fall jacket.",
      "I was far too stressed finding the proper size for this blazer. For reference, in Lululemon tops I am a 4 or 6, and 4 in their bottoms. I originally ordered size 0 in this blazer and was nervous it was going to be too small... When I tried it on though, it was giving \"Gru from Despicable Me\" vibes. Not cute! I ordered a 00 and that fit better, returned the 0.",
      "I love the craftsmanship and weight of the material on this blazer. It’s been perfect for three seasons of the year. Even when I sized down it still had a pretty oversized fit.",
      "This blazer is so very chic and a classic. Received many compliments. Can you tell I love, love, love it.  Not only beautiful but beautifully made.",
      "The different colors go well with each other and are comfortable to wear.",
      "I bought one size smaller. The blazer is stylish and practical.",
      "Love the boxy fit - soft texture and love the color",
      "Pleased with this soft drapey black/cream blazer. Not to heavy. Not cheap/flimsy. Lined and well made. Just-as-advertised modern oversize but not sloppy in my standard size. (Please don't size down expecting a tailored fit - its not made that way. This isn't just a too big tailored jacket.) Absolutely perfect for dressing up or down 300 days of the year. I have several costly wool blazers and now this is my favorite as nothing is softer while looking like a quality piece. I imagine if I was lucky enough to own a blazer from a Wallstreet great grandfather I didn't know I had... it would be like this."
